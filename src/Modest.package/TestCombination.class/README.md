The representation of the union of one or more so of Test

An Example of TestCombination :

Method : calcCoffeeIngredient -> The method studied
File : Coffee.java -> The file source of the method
Lines : 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 -> The union of combination
Coverage : 56 -> The number of covered instruction by the combination
Combination : [CoffeeTest.testCalcCoffeeIngredient_2,
CoffeeTest.testCalcCoffeeIngr	edient_3] -> Here we have a combination of two tests for the method calcCoffeeIngredient.

    Instance Variables
	combi:		<OrderedCollection> -> The variable who store our combination of Test
	coverage:		<Integer> -> The representation of the covered instruction of the combination
	file:		<ByteString> -> The file who come from the Test
	method:		<Method> -> The method studied for our combination
