An Example of TestCombination :

Method : calcCoffeeIngredient -> The method studied
File : Coffee.java -> The file source of the method
Lines : 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 -> The union of combination
Coverage : 56 -> The number of covered instruction by the combination
Combination : [CoffeeTest.testCalcCoffeeIngredient_2,
CoffeeTest.testCalcCoffeeIngredient_3] -> Here we have a combination of two tests for the method calcCoffeeIngredient.
